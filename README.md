This code implements a Tic Tac Toe game where a NAO robot plays against a human. It leverages NAO SDK proxies to control the robot's movements, speech, and camera. The game detects the current board state using OpenCV, processes the game logic with a Minimax algorithm, and allows the robot to interact socially during gameplay.

### Explanation of Key Parts:

1. **NAO Setup:**
   - The class initializes the connection to NAO using the IP and port.
   - Various NAO functionalities are initialized via proxies (e.g., `ALMotion`, `ALTextToSpeech`, `ALVideoDevice`).
   - The robot's posture is set to "Sit", and the robot's head is aligned to view the Tic Tac Toe board.

2. **Tic Tac Toe Detection:**
   - The `TicTacToeDetector` class is used to process the image and detect the state of the Tic Tac Toe board.
   - The board's state is stored and updated through the `current_board` and `previous_board` attributes.

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The Minimax algorithm (imported as `minimax`) is used for the AI's moves. The AI plays 'X' while the human player plays 'O'.
   - The robot uses text-to-speech (TTS) to announce its moves and respond to game events, making it socially interactive.

4. **Camera and Image Processing:**
   - The robot's camera captures images of the board, which are processed to detect the game's grid and players' moves.
   - The captured image is processed by OpenCV to detect circles (indicating 'O' moves).

5. **Robot Actions:**
   - The robot speaks phrases during gameplay to simulate thought ("I am thinking...").
   - It verbally announces its moves ("I am moving to the top left grid.") for interaction with the player.

6. **Game Loop:**
   - The game continues in a loop, where it constantly updates the board state, checks for a winner, and allows the AI to make its move after the player.
   - The loop can be exited by pressing 'q'.

### Dependencies:

- **NAO SDK:** This code uses the NAO SDK (NAOqi) to interact with the robot.
- **OpenCV:** Used for image processing and detection of the game board.
- **NumPy:** Utilized for image array manipulation and random choice for robot speech.
- **Minimax Algorithm:** The `minimax` module is used for calculating the AI's optimal moves.

### Improvements or Next Steps:

- **Arm Movements:** Add logic for the NAO robot to physically move its arm to the chosen grid cell after calculating a move.
- **Image Calibration:** Ensure that the board is correctly aligned in the camera's field of view for accurate detection.
- **Interactive Mode:** Implement a mode where the player can choose who goes first, and potentially add difficulty settings for the AI.
